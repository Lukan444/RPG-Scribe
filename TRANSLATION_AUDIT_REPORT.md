# Translation Audit Report

## 1. Overview

This report details the findings of an audit of the multi-language implementation in the application. The audit included a review of the internationalization (i18n) setup, translation file sources, supported languages, translation coverage, and language switching mechanisms.

The application uses `i18next` and `react-i18next` for its internationalization needs. Translations are loaded via `i18next-http-backend` from JSON files organized by language and namespace.

## 2. Current State of i18n Implementation

### 2.1. Configuration:
-   **i18n Library:** `i18next` with `react-i18next`.
-   **Translation Loading:** `i18next-http-backend` loads translations from `/public/locales/{lng}/{ns}.json`.
-   **Namespaces:** `common`, `entities`, `ui`.
-   **Language Detection:** Browser language detection is enabled, with fallback to English. Preferences are stored in `localStorage`.

### 2.2. Translation File Management:
-   **Consolidation:** Translation files were consolidated into the `/public/locales/` directory. Previously, some English and Polish translations were also stored in `src/i18n/locales/`, leading to inconsistencies. This has been rectified.
-   **File Naming:** Namespace files are now consistently named (e.g., `ui.json`). Previously, there was an inconsistency with `settings.json` vs `ui.json` for some languages.

### 2.3. Language Context and Persistence:
-   A `LanguageContext` manages three types of language preferences:
    -   `interfaceLanguage`: For the main UI. Persisted in `localStorage` (key: `rpg-scribe-language`).
    -   `transcriptionLanguage`: For speech-to-text features. Persisted in `localStorage` (key: `rpg-scribe-transcription-language`).
    -   `aiLanguage`: For AI-related communication. Persisted in `localStorage` (key: `rpg-scribe-ai-language`).
-   The `LanguageSelector.tsx` component correctly handles interface language changes.
-   The `LanguageSettings.tsx` component, intended for managing all three language types, has significant issues (see Section 4.2).

## 3. Supported Languages and Status

The application is configured to support the following languages:

-   **English (en):**
    -   `common.json`: Comprehensive.
    -   `entities.json`: Comprehensive.
    -   `ui.json`: Comprehensive.
    -   **Status: Complete.**

-   **Polish (pl):**
    -   Files (`common.json`, `entities.json`, `ui.json`) were copied from the more complete versions previously in `src/i18n/locales/`.
    -   **Status: Assumed to be relatively complete (pending human review for quality and 100% coverage against current English keys).**

-   **Spanish (es):**
    -   `common.json`: Highly incomplete. Missing many general application messages, status indicators, time/unit translations, and validation messages.
    -   `entities.json`: Highly incomplete. Only covers basic fields for Character, Location, and Item. Missing many generic entity terms, other entity types, actions, and messages.
    -   `ui.json`: Highly incomplete. Appears to primarily cover the settings page UI, missing the vast majority of general UI elements.
    -   **Status: Partial (Critically Incomplete).**

-   **French (fr):**
    -   `common.json`: Highly incomplete. Similar gaps to Spanish.
    -   `entities.json`: Highly incomplete. Similar gaps to Spanish.
    -   `ui.json`: Highly incomplete. Appears to primarily cover the settings page UI, similar to Spanish.
    -   **Status: Partial (Critically Incomplete).**

## 4. Identified Issues

### 4.1. Incomplete Translations for Spanish and French
-   As detailed above, the `es` and `fr` languages lack a significant number of translations across all namespaces. This will result in a mixed-language experience for users selecting these languages.

### 4.2. Dysfunctional Language Settings for Transcription and AI Languages
-   The `LanguageSettings.tsx` component:
    -   Uses mock, hardcoded lists of languages for Transcription and AI features, not necessarily reflecting actually supported or configured languages.
    -   Does not load the currently saved preferences for `transcriptionLanguage` and `aiLanguage` from `LanguageContext` or `localStorage`.
    -   Does not save changes to `transcriptionLanguage` and `aiLanguage` to `LanguageContext` or `localStorage`. The "Save" functionality is a stub.

### 4.3. Potential for Missing Keys in Polish
-   While Polish files were consolidated from what appeared to be more complete versions, a formal key-by-key comparison against the current English files was not performed by this audit. Missing keys might exist.

## 5. Recommendations for Improvement

### 5.1. Complete Missing Translations (High Priority)
-   **Action:** Prioritize the complete translation of all English keys into Spanish and French for all namespaces (`common.json`, `entities.json`, `ui.json`).
-   **Suggestion:** Engage professional translators or community members fluent in these languages to ensure high-quality and accurate translations.

### 5.2. Fix Language Settings Functionality (High Priority)
-   **Action:** Refactor `LanguageSettings.tsx`:
    1.  Replace mock language lists for Transcription and AI with appropriate sources (e.g., `supportedLanguages` from i18n config, dedicated configs, or backend data).
    2.  Integrate fully with `LanguageContext`:
        -   Use the `useLanguage()` hook to read `transcriptionLanguage`, `aiLanguage`, and their respective setters.
        -   Initialize component state with these context values.
        -   Ensure the "Save" button (or on-change handlers) use the context setters to persist changes, which will also update `localStorage`.
    3.  Verify and correct the import path for the `LanguageSelector` component if necessary.

### 5.3. Implement Translation Management & Validation (Medium Priority)
-   **Action:** Develop or integrate tools/scripts to:
    -   Automatically compare translation keys between English (primary) and other supported languages to identify missing or orphaned keys.
    -   Validate JSON file syntax.
-   **Suggestion:** For long-term maintenance and scalability, consider adopting a dedicated translation management platform (e.g., Lokalise, Weblate, Crowdin).

### 5.4. Verify Polish Translation Completeness (Medium Priority)
-   **Action:** Perform a key-by-key comparison of Polish translation files against the English master files to identify and address any missing translations.

### 5.5. Test All Languages and Configurations (Medium Priority)
-   **Action:** Thoroughly test the language switching functionality for all supported languages (`en`, `pl`, `es`, `fr`).
-   **Action:** Verify that all translation namespaces load correctly and that there are no console errors related to missing files or misconfigurations.

### 5.6. Review `LanguageSelector.tsx` `useEffect` (Low Priority)
-   **Action:** Briefly review the `useEffect` hook in `LanguageSelector.tsx` responsible for setting the initial language state to ensure it behaves as expected under all conditions and aligns with React best practices for handling external state changes.

## 6. Conclusion

The application has a solid foundation for multi-language support using `i18next`. Key structural improvements have been made during this audit, such as consolidating translation file sources and standardizing configurations.

The most critical areas for immediate attention are the completion of Spanish and French translations and the rectification of the `LanguageSettings.tsx` component to ensure all language preferences are manageable and persistent. Implementing robust translation management practices will further enhance the quality and maintainability of the internationalization features.
