# Jest to Vitest Migration - Completion Report

## Overview

The migration from Jest to Vitest has been successfully completed. This document summarizes the changes made and confirms that all tests are now running with Vitest.

## Changes Made

1. **Directory Structure**
   - Created a new `vitest-utils` directory to store all Vitest-specific test utilities
   - Moved all mock files from `tests/mocks` to `tests/vitest-utils`
   - Removed empty directories: `tests/mocks`, `tests/setup`, and `tests/utils`

2. **Test Files**
   - Migrated all test files to use Vitest syntax
   - Updated import paths to point to the new `vitest-utils` directory
   - Renamed test files to use the `.vitest.ts` or `.vitest.tsx` extension

3. **Mock Files**
   - Updated all mock files to use Vitest's mocking functions (`vi.fn()` instead of `jest.fn()`)
   - Consolidated mock files in the `vitest-utils` directory

4. **Configuration**
   - Removed Jest-specific configuration files
   - Added Vitest configuration in `vitest.config.ts`
   - Updated `package.json` scripts to use Vitest

5. **Dependencies**
   - Removed Jest-related dependencies
   - Added Vitest-related dependencies

## Test Coverage

All tests are now passing with Vitest. The test suite includes:

- Unit tests for services
- Component tests for UI components
- Integration tests for Firebase/Firestore interactions

## Benefits of Vitest

1. **Performance**: Vitest is significantly faster than Jest, especially for React components.
2. **ESM Support**: Vitest has native support for ES modules.
3. **TypeScript Support**: Vitest has better TypeScript support out of the box.
4. **Mantine Compatibility**: Vitest works better with Mantine UI components.
5. **Modern API**: Vitest provides a more modern and flexible API.

## Next Steps

1. **Add More Tests**: Continue adding tests for new components and services.
2. **Improve Test Coverage**: Aim for higher test coverage across the codebase.
3. **Implement E2E Tests**: Consider adding end-to-end tests using Playwright or Cypress.

## Conclusion

The migration from Jest to Vitest has been successfully completed. All tests are now running with Vitest, and the test suite is more maintainable and faster than before.
