  ```css
  .chevron {
    width: 16px !important;
    height: 16px !important;
    min-width: 16px !important;
    min-height: 16px !important;
    flex-shrink: 0;
  }
  ```

## Implementation Order (Based on Dependencies)

1. **Icon Standardization** (foundation for UI consistency) [COMPLETED]
   - Create icon configuration system first with the defined entity categories:
     - Characters & NPCs Group (Character, Faction)
     - World Elements Group (Location, Item)
     - Narrative Group (Event, Session, StoryArc, Note)
     - RPG World (parent category)
   - Update navigation components to use standardized icons
   - Implement the hierarchical grouping structure
   - This provides the foundation for consistent UI across the application

2. **Entity Management Access** (provides navigation structure) [COMPLETED]
   - Create the Entity Manager navigation section with the same hierarchical groups
   - Implement the EntityManagerPage component with corresponding tabs for each group
   - Update routing configuration to reflect the entity categories
   - This establishes the navigation structure for all entity types

3. **Relationship Count Calculation** (required for badges) [COMPLETED]
   - Enhance RelationshipService with count functionality
   - Create RelationshipCountBadge component
   - Integrate badges into the UI, respecting the hierarchical grouping
   - This provides the data for relationship visualization

4. **TypeScript Fixes and Mantine 8 Compatibility** (critical for application stability) [COMPLETED]
   - Fix Stack components using deprecated 'spacing' prop
   - Fix Group components using deprecated 'position' prop
   - Add proper null/undefined checks
   - This ensures the application is stable and uses Mantine 8 correctly

5. **Mock Data Replacement** (required for production readiness) [COMPLETED]
   - Replace mock data in Dashboard [COMPLETED]
   - Replace hardcoded IDs in entity pages [COMPLETED]
   - Implement Firebase transactions [COMPLETED]
   - Verify TypeScript configuration for iterator support [COMPLETED]
   - This ensures the application uses real data and is ready for production

6. **Visual Representation of Relationships** (builds on previous work)
   - Create RelationshipPreview component
   - Develop MiniRelationshipWeb component
   - Enhance entity detail pages
   - Ensure relationship visualizations respect the entity grouping categories
   - This completes the relationship visualization features

## Implementation Notes

### General Guidelines
1. Run the application after completing each subtask to verify it functions correctly
2. Fix any TypeScript errors that appear before proceeding to the next subtask
3. Update this file after each completed subtask by:
   - Marking the task as complete with `[x]` instead of `[ ]`
   - Adding a timestamp and implementation notes
   - Documenting any issues encountered and their solutions
4. Use Mantine 8 component props correctly (e.g., `leftSection` instead of `leftIcon`)
5. Follow Mantine 8 styling conventions (e.g., `style` prop instead of `sx`)
6. Ensure proper TypeScript typing for all components and functions

### TypeScript Fixes Best Practices
1. **Stack Components**:
   - Replace `spacing` with `gap` for consistent spacing
   - Use `align` instead of `alignItems` for alignment
   - Use `justify` instead of `justifyContent` for justification
   - Ensure proper typing with `StackProps` interface

2. **Group Components**:
   - Replace `position` with `justify` for horizontal alignment
   - Use `align` for vertical alignment
   - Use `gap` instead of `spacing` for spacing between items
   - Ensure proper typing with `GroupProps` interface

3. **Null Safety**:
   - Use optional chaining (`?.`) for accessing properties that might be undefined
   - Use nullish coalescing (`??`) for providing default values
   - Use type guards (`if (value)`) for conditional rendering
   - Add explicit null checks where appropriate
   - Use default values in destructuring: `const { prop = defaultValue } = object`

### Firebase/Firestore Best Practices
1. **Transactions**:
   - Use transactions for operations that need to be atomic
   - Read all documents first, then perform writes
   - Keep transactions small and focused
   - Handle transaction failures with proper error handling
   - Use batch operations for multiple writes that don't depend on reads

2. **Query Optimization**:
   - Create proper indexes for complex queries
   - Limit the number of documents returned
   - Use compound queries to reduce the number of reads
   - Implement pagination for large data sets
   - Cache frequently accessed data

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement proper error handling for all Firestore operations
   - Provide user-friendly error messages
   - Log detailed error information for debugging
   - Implement retry mechanisms for transient errors
   - Use try/catch blocks for all async operations
