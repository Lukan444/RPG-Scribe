# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

"RPG-Archivist-Web2" exists to provide a comprehensive platform for users (likely Game Masters and players) to organize, manage, and visualize information related to their tabletop role-playing game campaigns. Traditional methods like paper notes, scattered documents, or generic note-taking apps can become unwieldy for complex, long-running games. This project aims to offer a dedicated, structured solution.

## Problems It Solves

*   **Information Overload:** RPG campaigns generate vast amounts of data (characters, locations, events, notes, etc.). This tool helps structure and manage this data.
*   **Disconnected Information:** Helps link related entities (e.g., a character's involvement in an event, a location's significance in a campaign).
*   **Collaboration (Potentially):** May facilitate sharing information between a Game Master and players, or among a group.
*   **Recall and Reference:** Provides an easy way to look up details from past sessions or about specific game elements.
*   **Campaign Planning & Worldbuilding:** Assists GMs in developing and maintaining their game worlds.

## How It Should Work (Ideal State)

*   Users can create, view, edit, and delete various types of game entities (Campaigns, Characters, Locations, Items, Notes, Sessions, RPGWorlds, etc.).
*   Data entered should be persisted reliably in a backend database (likely Firestore, given `firestore.indexes.json` and `rpg-archivist-26e43-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-42f9945d17.json`).
*   UI components should dynamically fetch and display this persisted data, not mock or placeholder data.
*   Relationships between entities should be establishable and visualizable.
*   The application should provide a clear, intuitive user interface for navigating and interacting with the data.
*   AI features might assist with content generation, summarization, or providing insights.

## User Experience Goals

*   **Intuitive Data Entry & Management:** Users should find it easy to add and update information.
*   **Clear Visualization:** Complex relationships and large amounts of data should be presented in an understandable way.
*   **Responsive & Performant:** The application should load data and respond to user interactions quickly.
*   **Reliable Data Display:** Users must trust that the data they see is accurate and up-to-date from the backend. This is directly related to the current problem.
*   **Organized Overview:** Users should be able to get a good overview of their campaign elements and how they connect.
