## Database Models and Types

### 1. Add Validation Rules for Entity Properties
- **Description**: Implement validation rules for entity properties to ensure data integrity
- **Files**: All model files in `src/models/`
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Notes**: Consider using a validation library like Zod or Yup for runtime validation

### 2. Implement Type Guards for Entity Type Checking
- **Description**: Add type guard functions to check if an object is a specific entity type
- **Files**: `src/models/EntityType.ts`
- **Priority**: Low
- **Notes**: This would improve type safety when working with entities from Firestore

### 3. Add Serialization/Deserialization Methods for Firestore
- **Description**: Implement methods to convert between entity models and Firestore documents
- **Files**: All model files in `src/models/`
- **Priority**: High
- **Notes**: This would handle Date objects, nested objects, and other Firestore-specific conversions

### 4. Enhance Relationship Model
- **Description**: Consider a more robust relationship model with metadata
- **Files**: `src/models/Relationship.ts`, all entity model files
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Notes**: Current approach uses simple ID references; a more robust approach could include relationship types, timestamps, etc.

## Database Services

### 1. Optimize Caching Strategy
- **Description**: Implement a more sophisticated caching strategy with LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy
- **Files**: `src/services/firestore.service.ts`
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Notes**: Current implementation uses a simple in-memory cache with TTL; a more robust solution would use IndexedDB for persistence

### 2. Implement Conflict Resolution for Offline Changes
- **Description**: Add conflict resolution strategies for when offline changes conflict with server changes
- **Files**: `src/services/firestore.service.ts`
- **Priority**: High
- **Notes**: Current implementation simply applies changes in order; need to implement proper merging strategies

### 3. Add Support for Complex Queries with Composite Indexes
- **Description**: Enhance query capabilities to support complex queries that require composite indexes
- **Files**: `src/services/firestore.service.ts`
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Notes**: Need to add support for creating and managing composite indexes

### 4. Implement Rate Limiting and Quota Management
- **Description**: Add rate limiting to prevent exceeding Firestore quotas
- **Files**: `src/services/firestore.service.ts`
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Notes**: Should include retry with exponential backoff for quota exceeded errors

### 5. Add Support for Security Rules Testing
- **Description**: Implement tools for testing Firestore security rules
- **Files**: New files in `src/services/testing/`
- **Priority**: Low
- **Notes**: Would help ensure that security rules are properly implemented

### 6. Enhance Performance Monitoring
- **Description**: Integrate with Firebase Performance Monitoring for more detailed metrics
- **Files**: `src/services/firestore.service.ts`
- **Priority**: Low
- **Notes**: Current implementation uses simple in-memory metrics; Firebase Performance would provide more insights

### 7. Implement Data Migration Utilities
- **Description**: Add utilities for migrating data between different schema versions
- **Files**: New files in `src/services/migration/`
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Notes**: Would help with schema evolution over time

### 8. Add Support for Firestore Bundles
- **Description**: Implement support for Firestore bundles for faster initial data loading
- **Files**: `src/services/firestore.service.ts`
- **Priority**: Low
- **Notes**: Bundles can significantly improve initial load performance for read-heavy applications
