# Cytoscape Mind Map Next Steps

## Overview

This document outlines the next steps for completing the Cytoscape Mind Map implementation in the RPG Archivist application. The Cytoscape Mind Map is a robust alternative to the ReactFlow-based Mind Map visualization, offering more features and better stability.

## Current Status

We have successfully implemented a basic Cytoscape Mind Map component with the following features:

- Multiple layout algorithms (force-directed, hierarchical, etc.)
- Interactive controls for zooming, panning, and layout selection
- Node and edge styling based on entity types
- Export functionality for PNG images
- Integration with the existing Mind Map page

However, there are still some issues that need to be addressed:

- TypeScript errors related to missing type definitions for Cytoscape.js extensions
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Advanced filtering options
- Graph analysis features

## Next Steps

### 1. Fix TypeScript Errors

1. **Create Type Declaration Files**:
   - Create a `types` directory in the frontend project
   - Create type declaration files for Cytoscape.js extensions:
     ```typescript
     // types/cytoscape-cola.d.ts
     declare module 'cytoscape-cola';
     
     // types/cytoscape-dagre.d.ts
     declare module 'cytoscape-dagre';
     ```
   - Update `tsconfig.json` to include the type declaration files:
     ```json
     {
       "compilerOptions": {
         "typeRoots": ["./node_modules/@types", "./src/types"]
       }
     }
     ```

2. **Fix Layout Options Type Errors**:
   - Create custom interfaces for layout options:
     ```typescript
     interface ColaLayoutOptions extends cytoscape.LayoutOptions {
       nodeSpacing?: number;
       edgeLengthVal?: number;
       animate?: boolean;
       randomize?: boolean;
       maxSimulationTime?: number;
     }
     
     interface DagreLayoutOptions extends cytoscape.LayoutOptions {
       rankDir?: string;
       rankSep?: number;
       nodeSep?: number;
       ranker?: string;
     }
     ```
   - Update the `getLayoutConfig` method to use these interfaces

### 2. Optimize Performance

1. **Implement Lazy Loading**:
   - Load only the visible portion of the graph initially
   - Load additional nodes and edges as the user navigates
   - Implement a loading indicator for large datasets

2. **Add Caching**:
   - Cache graph data to avoid redundant API calls
   - Implement a cache invalidation strategy
   - Add a refresh button to force data reload

3. **Optimize Rendering**:
   - Use simplified node and edge styles for large datasets
   - Implement level-of-detail rendering based on zoom level
   - Use WebGL rendering for better performance

### 3. Add Advanced Filtering

1. **Implement Filter Panel**:
   - Create a dedicated filter panel component
   - Add filters for node types, edge types, and properties
   - Implement filter presets for common use cases

2. **Add Search Functionality**:
   - Implement node and edge search by name or property
   - Highlight search results in the graph
   - Add search history and suggestions

3. **Implement Relationship Filtering**:
   - Filter by relationship type
   - Filter by relationship direction
   - Filter by relationship properties

### 4. Add Graph Analysis Features

1. **Implement Centrality Measures**:
   - Add degree centrality calculation
   - Add betweenness centrality calculation
   - Add closeness centrality calculation
   - Visualize centrality with node size or color

2. **Add Clustering**:
   - Implement community detection algorithms
   - Visualize clusters with node colors
   - Add cluster expansion/collapse functionality

3. **Add Path Analysis**:
   - Find shortest path between nodes
   - Calculate path length and properties
   - Highlight paths in the graph

### 5. Enhance User Experience

1. **Add Custom Styling**:
   - Allow users to customize node and edge styles
   - Implement style presets for different visualization needs
   - Save and load custom styles

2. **Add Saved Views**:
   - Allow users to save graph views with specific filters and layouts
   - Implement view sharing between users
   - Add view thumbnails for easy selection

3. **Improve Interaction**:
   - Add context menus for nodes and edges
   - Implement drag-and-drop relationship creation
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions

## Conclusion

The Cytoscape Mind Map implementation is a significant improvement over the ReactFlow-based visualization, offering more features and better stability. By addressing the remaining issues and implementing the planned enhancements, we will provide users with a powerful tool for visualizing and analyzing the relationships between entities in their RPG campaigns.

The implementation will be completed in phases, with each phase building on the previous one. This approach will allow us to deliver incremental improvements while ensuring that the core functionality remains stable and usable.
