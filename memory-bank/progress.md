# Progress

## What Works

*   The basic project structure is in place (React, TypeScript, Firebase).
*   UI components exist and are properly connected to Firestore.
*   A backend (Firebase/Firestore) is fully implemented and contains live data.
*   The Dashboard and Admin pages are using real Firestore queries with proper error handling.
*   Entity services are correctly implemented to fetch data from Firestore.
*   TypeScript configuration is properly set up with downlevelIteration enabled.
*   A system for mock data (`src/services/mockData.service.ts`) exists but is only used as a fallback when there's an error fetching real data.
*   Memory Bank core files have been initialized.

## What's Left to Build/Fix

*   **Documentation:** Ensure all components and services are properly documented with JSDoc comments.
*   **Cleanup:** Remove any unused mock data references in the codebase that might still exist.
*   **Test Coverage:** Increase test coverage using the new mocking patterns.

## Current Status

*   **Phase:** Implementation and Testing.
*   **Current Activity:** Implementing standardized testing approach and improving test coverage.
*   **Blockers:** None. The application is working correctly with real data and has a solid testing foundation.
*   **Confidence Level:** High. The application is properly fetching and displaying real data from Firestore, and we now have a standardized approach for testing.

## Findings

*   **Primary Finding:** The application is correctly using real data from Firestore. The mock data service is only used as a fallback when there's an error fetching real data.
*   **TypeScript Configuration:** The downlevelIteration flag is already enabled in tsconfig.json, which allows for proper iterator support.
*   **Entity Services:** All entity services are properly implemented to fetch data from Firestore, with some services having an API fallback option.
*   **Dashboard Component:** The Dashboard component is correctly fetching data from Firestore services and only using mock data as a fallback when there's an error.
*   **Example Components:** Example components have been removed and their patterns documented in memory-bank/example-component-patterns.md.
*   **Testing Approach:** A standardized testing approach has been implemented with proper mocking patterns for Firestore and other dependencies. Templates and documentation have been created to guide future test development.
