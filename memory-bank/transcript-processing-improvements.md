# Transcript Processing Improvements

## Overview
This document tracks the improvements made to the transcript processing system in the RPG Archivist application. The transcript processing system is responsible for efficiently processing audio transcriptions during live RPG sessions, breaking them into manageable chunks, and feeding them to the AI Brain for analysis.

## Phase 1: Frontend UI for Transcript Processing Settings (Completed)
- Created a `TranscriptSettingsPanel` component in the Settings section of the UI
- Implemented form controls for configuring chunk size, overlap percentage, and processing strategy
- Added visual explanations and tooltips for each setting to help users understand their impact
- Created API service methods to fetch and update transcript processing settings
- Implemented real-time validation and feedback for settings values
- Added a "Reset to Defaults" button for each subscription tier
- Created visual indicators showing current processing status in the Live Play interface

## Phase 2: Advanced Processing Strategies (Completed)

- Created a hybrid strategy that combines time-based, size-based, and content-based approaches
  - Implemented fixed interval backup processing
  - Implemented content-based triggers
  - Implemented size-based triggers

- Implemented performance metrics collection to help users optimize their settings
  - Added tracking for processed chunks, segments, and characters
  - Added tracking for processing times
  - Added tracking for chunk sizes
  - Added tracking for trigger types
  - Created a performance metrics UI dashboard

## Phase 3: Context-Aware Processing (Completed)
- Implemented speaker identification to link transcript segments to characters
  - Added `SpeakerIdentification` interface with character and user linking
  - Enhanced `TranscriptionSegment` with detailed speaker information
  - Added speaker extraction in chunk processing
- Added entity recognition to identify mentions of characters, locations, and items
  - Created `TranscriptEntity` model for structured entity representation
  - Implemented pattern-based entity detection for characters, locations, and items
  - Added entity extraction in chunk processing
- Created a context preservation system that maintains information across chunks
  - Enhanced `ProcessedChunk` interface with context-aware fields
  - Added importance scoring for segments and chunks
  - Implemented sentiment analysis for emotional content
- Implemented adaptive overlap based on content importance
  - Adjusted overlap percentage based on content importance
  - Prioritized segments with important entities in overlap
  - Added dynamic adjustment of overlap based on speaker changes
- Added support for session-specific vocabulary and terminology
  - Created vocabulary management system with term types and aliases
  - Implemented vocabulary-based entity recognition
  - Added API endpoints for managing vocabulary
  - Created UI components for vocabulary management

## Phase 4: Optimization and Scaling (In Progress)
- Implement parallel processing for large transcripts (Completed)
  - Created a worker pool system for parallel processing of chunks
  - Added configuration options for controlling parallel processing
  - Implemented adaptive processing based on content size
  - Added performance metrics for parallel processing
  - Created UI components for managing parallel processing settings
- Add support for distributed processing across multiple nodes (Planned)
- Create a caching system for frequently accessed chunks (Completed)
  - Implemented multi-level caching (memory and disk)
  - Added importance-based caching for prioritizing important content
  - Created cache management API endpoints
  - Added cache statistics and monitoring
  - Implemented cache warming for premium tier
  - Created UI components for cache management
- Implement compression for long-term storage of processed chunks (Completed)
  - Created compression utility with multiple algorithms (GZIP, Deflate, Brotli)
  - Implemented compressed storage for long-term archiving of chunks
  - Added adaptive compression based on content importance
  - Created compression statistics and analysis tools
  - Implemented UI components for compression management
  - Integrated with existing cache system
- Add support for incremental updates to processed chunks (Completed)
  - Created chunk diff utility for comparing and merging chunks
  - Implemented version tracking for processed chunks
  - Added incremental update processing to chunk manager
  - Created API endpoints for chunk management
  - Added version history tracking and restoration
  - Implemented UI component for viewing version history

## Technical Details

### Chunk Processing Strategies
1. **Fixed Interval**: Processes chunks at regular time intervals
2. **Size-Based**: Processes chunks when they reach a certain size
3. **Content-Based**: Processes chunks when significant content is detected
4. **User Idle**: Processes chunks when the user is inactive
5. **Hybrid**: Combines multiple strategies for optimal processing

### Performance Metrics
The system now collects the following metrics:
- Total chunks processed
- Total segments processed
- Total characters processed
- Processing times
- Chunk sizes
- Segments per chunk
- Strategy triggers (what caused each chunk to be processed)
- Uptime
- Average processing time
- Average chunk size
- Average segments per chunk
- Chunks per minute

### Subscription Tier Differences
- **Community Tier**:
  - Default strategy: Size-Based
  - Chunk size range: 500-2000 characters
  - Overlap percentage: 20%
  - Processing interval: 30 seconds
  - Context chunks: 1

- **Premium Tier**:
  - Default strategy: Hybrid
  - Chunk size range: 200-4000 characters
  - Overlap percentage: 30%
  - Processing interval: 15 seconds
  - Context chunks: 3

## Future Considerations
- Integration with speech recognition systems for real-time processing
- Support for multi-language transcripts
- Advanced sentiment analysis for emotional context
- Integration with character sheets for better context awareness
- Support for custom processing rules defined by the Game Master
