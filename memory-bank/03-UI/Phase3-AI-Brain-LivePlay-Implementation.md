## Next Steps

1. **Complete Proposal Review Interface**:
   - Create ProposalComponent for reviewing and managing AI-generated proposals
   - Implement proposal display with filtering and sorting
   - Add approval/rejection workflow
   - Implement proposal details and editing

2. **Implement AI-Generated Content Previews**:

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Flow
- Audio data is captured using the Web Audio API
- Audio is processed and sent to the backend for transcription
- Transcribed text is displayed in the UI and sent to the LLM for processing
- LLM responses are displayed in the UI and can be converted to speech
- Proposals are generated from the LLM responses and can be reviewed and approved

### State Management
- Component state is managed using React hooks
- Audio recording state is managed by the AudioRecordingService
- Transcription state is managed by the TranscriptionService
- Storytelling state is managed by the StorytellingService
- Global state is shared between components using context

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling for all API calls
- Fallback mechanisms for development mode
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms for failed API calls
- Graceful degradation for unsupported browsers

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient audio processing
- Optimized rendering for real-time updates
- Lazy loading for heavy components
- Caching for frequently accessed data
- Proper cleanup of resources

## Conclusion
The AI Brain and Live Play components provide powerful tools for RPG campaign management. The implementation follows best practices for React development and ensures proper separation of concerns between components. The next steps will focus on completing the remaining components and integrating them into a cohesive interface.
