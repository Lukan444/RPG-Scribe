# Mind Map Component Issues

## Current Status

The Mind Map component is currently experiencing JavaScript errors that prevent it from rendering properly. The main error is:

```
selection.interrupt is not a function TypeError: selection.interrupt is not a function at zoom.transform
```

This error occurs in the d3-zoom library when trying to apply zoom transformations to the SVG elements.

## Attempted Solutions

1. **SimpleMindMap Component**: A simplified version of the Mind Map component has been created as a fallback. This component doesn't use d3-zoom and instead displays the graph data in a simple list format.

2. **Graph Controller Updates**: The graph controller has been updated to handle arrays of node types and edge types correctly, which should fix some of the issues with the API endpoints.

## Recommended Solutions

1. **Use Cytoscape.js**: As recommended by the user, Cytoscape.js should be used for the Mind Map visualization instead of d3-zoom. Cytoscape.js provides built-in support for graph visualization, zooming, panning, and other interactive features.

2. **Implement Proper Error Handling**: The Mind Map component should implement proper error handling to gracefully degrade to the SimpleMindMap component when errors occur.

3. **Update Dependencies**: The d3-zoom library may need to be updated to a newer version that doesn't have the `selection.interrupt` issue.

## Next Steps

1. Create a new Mind Map component using Cytoscape.js
2. Implement proper error handling in the Mind Map component
3. Update the MindMapPage to use the new Cytoscape.js-based Mind Map component
4. Test the new Mind Map component with real data from the Neo4j database
