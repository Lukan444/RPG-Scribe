# Database Services Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Database Services section of the Entity Management system. The plan has been updated based on a review of the existing codebase and Mantine 8 documentation.

## Overview

The Database Services section focuses on implementing the core functionality for interacting with the Firebase/Firestore database. This includes CRUD operations, queries, real-time listeners, and transaction support for all entity types.

## Implementation Tasks

### 2.1. Enhance FirestoreService Base Class (Complexity: High)

**Objective**: Extend the existing FirestoreService class to support complex queries, transactions, batch operations, and real-time listeners.

**Implementation Details**:
- Add support for complex queries with multiple conditions
- Implement transaction support for atomic operations
- Add batch operations for multiple entities
- Implement real-time listeners with proper cleanup
- Add error handling and retry logic
- Implement offline persistence support

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/services/firestore.service.ts`

### 2.2. Implement CharacterService (Complexity: Medium)

**Objective**: Create a service for Character entity CRUD operations and queries.

**Implementation Details**:
- Extend FirestoreService for Character entity
- Implement character-specific query methods (getByType, getByFaction, etc.)
- Add methods for managing character relationships
- Implement real-time listeners for character updates

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `src/services/character.service.ts`

### 2.3. Implement LocationService (Complexity: Medium)

**Objective**: Create a service for Location entity CRUD operations and queries.

**Implementation Details**:
- Extend FirestoreService for Location entity
- Implement location-specific query methods (getByParent, getByType, etc.)
- Add methods for managing location hierarchy
- Implement real-time listeners for location updates

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `src/services/location.service.ts`

### 2.4. Implement ItemService (Complexity: Medium)

**Objective**: Create a service for Item entity CRUD operations and queries.

**Implementation Details**:
- Extend FirestoreService for Item entity
- Implement item-specific query methods (getByType, getByOwner, etc.)
- Add methods for transferring ownership
- Implement real-time listeners for item updates

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `src/services/item.service.ts`

### 2.5. Implement EventService (Complexity: Medium)

**Objective**: Create a service for Event entity CRUD operations and queries.

**Implementation Details**:
- Extend FirestoreService for Event entity
- Implement event-specific query methods (getByType, getByDate, getByLocation, etc.)
- Add methods for timeline operations
- Implement real-time listeners for event updates

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `src/services/event.service.ts`

### 2.6. Implement SessionService (Complexity: Medium)

**Objective**: Create a service for Session entity CRUD operations and queries.

**Implementation Details**:
- Extend FirestoreService for Session entity
- Implement session-specific query methods (getByDate, getCompleted, etc.)
- Add methods for transcript and summary operations
- Implement real-time listeners for session updates

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `src/services/session.service.ts`

### 2.7. Implement FactionService (Complexity: High)

**Objective**: Create a service for Faction entity CRUD operations and queries.

**Implementation Details**:
- Extend FirestoreService for Faction entity
- Implement faction-specific query methods (getByType, getByLeader, etc.)
- Add methods for managing faction relationships (allies, enemies)
- Implement real-time listeners for faction updates

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `src/services/faction.service.ts`

### 2.8. Implement StoryArcService (Complexity: High)

**Objective**: Create a service for StoryArc entity CRUD operations and queries.

**Implementation Details**:
- Extend FirestoreService for StoryArc entity
- Implement story arc-specific query methods (getByType, getByStatus, etc.)
- Add methods for managing story arc progression
- Implement real-time listeners for story arc updates

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `src/services/storyArc.service.ts`

### 2.9. Create EntityServiceFactory (Complexity: Medium)

**Objective**: Implement a factory to create the appropriate service based on entity type.

**Implementation Details**:
- Create a factory class that returns the appropriate service based on entity type
- Add caching for service instances to avoid creating multiple instances
- Implement proper cleanup for real-time listeners
- Add error handling for invalid entity types

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `src/services/entityService.factory.ts`

## Implementation Approach

1. Start with enhancing the FirestoreService base class to provide a solid foundation for all entity services
2. Implement each entity service one by one, starting with the most fundamental ones (Character, Location)
3. Test each service thoroughly before moving to the next one
4. Finally, implement the EntityServiceFactory to provide a unified interface for all entity services

## Leveraging Existing Code

The existing codebase already has a FirestoreService base class that provides basic CRUD operations. We'll enhance this class and extend it for each entity type. The existing RPGWorldService can serve as a reference for implementing entity-specific services.

## Testing Strategy

For each service:
1. Write unit tests for all methods
2. Test with mock Firestore data
3. Test error handling and edge cases
4. Test real-time listeners and cleanup

## Future Considerations

- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Offline support and conflict resolution
- Security rules implementation
- Rate limiting and quota management
