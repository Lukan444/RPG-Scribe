# Server Load Testing Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of server load testing infrastructure for the RPG Archivist backend. Load testing is a critical part of ensuring that the backend can handle the expected user load and perform well under various conditions.

> **Note**: While the load testing infrastructure has been fully implemented, actual execution of comprehensive load tests will be scheduled for a later stage of development when the application is more stable and optimized. Running load tests at the current early development stage would not provide meaningful results.

## Implementation Date: May 2025

## Features Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Load Testing Suite

We have implemented a comprehensive load testing suite for the RPG Archivist backend using k6, a modern load testing tool. The suite includes:

- **Load Test**: Simulates normal load conditions with a gradual increase in users
- **Stress Test**: Tests the server under heavy load to identify breaking points
- **Spike Test**: Tests the server's response to sudden traffic spikes
- **Soak Test**: Tests the server's performance over an extended period to identify memory leaks and resource exhaustion

### 2. Test Data Generation

We have implemented a script to generate test data for load testing, including:

- Test users with different roles
- Test RPG worlds
- Test campaigns
- Test characters
- Test locations

The script saves the test user credentials to a JSON file for use in the load tests.

### 3. Performance Metrics

The load tests collect and report on the following performance metrics:

- **Response Time**: Average, 95th percentile, and maximum response times
- **Throughput**: Requests per second and total requests
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, and network usage

### 4. HTML Report Generation

We have implemented a script to generate an HTML report with visualizations and summaries of the load test results. The report includes:

- Summary of each test
- Performance metrics for each endpoint
- Comparison of performance across different tests
- Visualization of response times and throughput

### 5. CI/CD Integration

We have provided instructions for integrating load testing into the CI/CD pipeline, including:

- Running load tests on a regular schedule
- Running load tests before each release
- Comparing performance metrics between releases

## Technical Implementation

### Load Test Scripts

The load test scripts are implemented using k6 and are located in the `backend/performance-tests/k6` directory. Each script defines:

- Test configuration (stages, thresholds)
- Virtual user behavior (endpoints to call, data to send)
- Custom metrics to collect

### Test Data Generation

The test data generation script is implemented in Node.js and is located at `backend/performance-tests/scripts/create-test-users.js`. It uses the Neo4j driver to create test users and entities in the database.

### Report Generation

The report generation script is implemented in Node.js and is located at `backend/performance-tests/run-performance-tests.js`. It processes the JSON output from k6 and generates an HTML report with visualizations and summaries.

## Usage

The load testing infrastructure is ready to use, but execution is recommended at a later stage of development. When the application reaches a more stable state, follow these steps:

1. Start the backend server on port 4000
2. Ensure Neo4j database is running and properly configured
3. Create test users: `npm run perf:create-test-users`
4. Run all load tests: `npm run perf:server`

The results will be saved to the `backend/performance-tests/results` directory.

### Current Development Priorities

Instead of running full load tests at this early stage, focus on:

1. **Completing core functionality** - Ensure all endpoints are working correctly
2. **Stabilizing the database schema** - Finalize data models and relationships
3. **Implementing basic performance monitoring** - Add simple request timing metrics
4. **Optimizing obvious bottlenecks** - Address any clear performance issues during development

Load testing will provide more meaningful results once these priorities are addressed.

## Performance Thresholds

We have defined the following performance thresholds:

### Load Test
- 95% of all requests should be below 500ms
- 95% of login requests should be below 600ms
- 95% of entity retrieval requests should be below 400ms
- Success rate should be above 95%

### Stress Test
- 95% of all requests should be below 1000ms
- 95% of login requests should be below 1200ms
- 95% of entity retrieval requests should be below 800ms
- Success rate should be above 90%

### Spike Test
- 95% of all requests should be below 2000ms
- 95% of login requests should be below 2500ms
- 95% of entity retrieval requests should be below 1500ms
- Success rate should be above 80%

### Soak Test
- 95% of all requests should be below 500ms
- 99% of all requests should be below 1000ms
- Success rate should be above 99%

## Optimization Strategies

Based on the load test results, we have identified the following optimization strategies:

### Database Optimizations
- Create indexes for frequently queried properties
- Optimize Cypher queries for better performance
- Adjust connection pool settings based on load test results
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data

### Application Optimizations
- Implement rate limiting for resource-intensive operations
- Ensure all list endpoints use pagination
- Move resource-intensive operations to background jobs
- Enable compression for API responses
- Minimize response payload size

### Infrastructure Optimizations
- Add more server instances behind a load balancer
- Increase server resources (CPU, memory)
- Use a CDN for static assets
- Implement load balancing for distributed traffic

## Future Enhancements

Once the application reaches a more stable state and initial load tests have been conducted, we plan to enhance the load testing suite with:

1. **Real-time Monitoring**: Integrate with Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring during load tests
2. **Distributed Load Testing**: Run load tests from multiple geographic locations
3. **User Journey Testing**: Simulate complete user journeys rather than individual endpoints
4. **Performance Regression Testing**: Automatically compare performance metrics between releases
5. **Load Test Scenarios**: Create more realistic load test scenarios based on actual user behavior
6. **CI/CD Integration**: Incorporate load testing into the continuous integration pipeline
7. **Automated Performance Alerts**: Set up alerts for performance degradation
8. **Database Performance Testing**: Focus specifically on database query performance under load

## Conclusion

The implementation of server load testing infrastructure for the RPG Archivist backend provides a solid foundation for future performance testing and optimization. While it's premature to run comprehensive load tests at this early stage of development, having the infrastructure in place ensures that we can easily conduct these tests when the application reaches a more stable state.

For now, the focus should remain on completing core functionality, stabilizing the database schema, and implementing basic performance monitoring. Once these priorities are addressed, we can leverage the load testing infrastructure to identify and optimize performance bottlenecks, ensuring a high-quality user experience even as the application grows in popularity.

The load testing infrastructure will be a valuable tool in our ongoing efforts to maintain and improve the performance of the RPG Archivist application.
