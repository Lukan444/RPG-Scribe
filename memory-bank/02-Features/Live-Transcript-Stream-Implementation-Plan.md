## Implementation Approach

### Priority Order for Implementation

1. **First Priority: Core Processing System**
   - Tasks [21-30]: Implement the `TranscriptChunkManager` and enhance `BrainService`
   - These components form the foundation of the entire feature

2. **Second Priority: Audio Processing**
   - Tasks [1-20]: Implement audio recording, upload, and processing components
   - These provide the input data for the transcript processing system

3. **Third Priority: Speaker Recognition**
   - Tasks [36-45]: Implement speaker diarization and character linking
   - These enhance the transcript with speaker information

4. **Fourth Priority: AI Analysis**
   - Tasks [46-55]: Implement highlight extraction and proposal generation
   - These provide the AI-powered insights from the transcripts

5. **Fifth Priority: User Interface**
   - Tasks [56-60]: Implement the user interface components
   - These make the feature accessible to users

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Vertical Slice Approach**
   - Implement a minimal version of each component first
   - Test the complete flow from audio recording to AI analysis
   - Iteratively enhance each component

2. **Dual-Path Development**
   - Implement community version components first
   - Add premium version enhancements in parallel
   - Ensure seamless switching between versions

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Create unit tests for each component
   - Implement integration tests for the complete flow
   - Add performance tests for optimized processing

4. **Documentation**
   - Document each component as it's implemented
   - Create user guides for both community and premium features
   - Add troubleshooting guides for common issues
