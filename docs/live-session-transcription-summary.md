## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### Speech Recognition Pipeline
The primary mechanism for live speech recognition involves:
`Audio Input (Client) → AudioCapture (Client) → HTTPS POST (audio chunk) → Firebase Function Proxy (Backend) → Google Cloud Speech SDK (streamingRecognize to Vertex AI) → Results back to Client`
A similar flow applies to OpenAI Whisper for file-based processing.
The `TranscriptionWebSocketService` may be used for other real-time notifications but is not the primary audio transport for AI STT services.

### AI Processing Pipeline
```
Transcription → Entity Extraction → Timeline Suggestions → Approval Workflow → Timeline Integration
```

### Data Flow Architecture
```
Live Session → Real-time Processing (via Proxies) → Firebase Storage → UI Components → Player Collaboration
```

## 📁 **File Structure**

### Components (`src/components/transcription/`)
- `LivePlayDashboard.tsx` - Main dashboard component
- `AudioCapture.tsx` - Audio recording interface
- `TranscriptViewer.tsx` - Transcript display and search
- `SessionBookmarks.tsx` - Bookmark management
- `TranscriptionTimelineIntegration.tsx` - Timeline integration
- `PlayerCollaborationInterface.tsx` - Collaboration features

### Services (`src/services/`)
- `LiveTranscriptionService.ts` - Core transcription orchestration
- `transcription.service.ts` - Data persistence and management
- `speech/VertexAISpeechService.ts` - Primary speech recognition (interacts with Firebase Function proxy)
- `speech/OpenAIWhisperService.ts` - Fallback speech recognition (interacts with Firebase Function proxy)

### Firebase Functions (`functions/src/index.ts`)
- `proxyVertexAISpeech` - Backend proxy for Vertex AI Speech-to-Text.
- `proxyOpenAIWhisper` - Backend proxy for OpenAI Whisper.


### Models (`src/models/`)
- `Transcription.ts` - Enhanced transcription data models
- Supporting interfaces and types

### Tests (`src/components/transcription/__tests__/`, `src/services/__tests__/`, `functions/src/__tests__/`)
- Unit tests for core frontend services (`LiveTranscriptionService`, `VertexAISpeechService`, `OpenAIWhisperService`).
- Unit tests for key frontend components (`AudioCapture`, `TranscriptViewer`).
- Unit tests for backend Firebase Function proxies (`proxyVertexAISpeech`, `proxyOpenAIWhisper`).
- Mock implementations for external dependencies (Firebase SDKs, AI Client SDKs).

## 🎯 **Performance Metrics**

### Latency Targets
- **Audio Processing (Client-side chunking)**: <500ms
- **Speech Recognition (Per Chunk via Proxy)**: Dependent on chunk size, network, proxy function execution, and AI service response time. Striving for quick display of interim results.
- **AI Analysis (Post-transcription)**: <1-2 seconds, depending on complexity.
- **Total End-to-End Latency for Live Segments**: Highly variable; aims for user perception of near real-time with interim results. Specific end-to-end guarantees (e.g., "<3 seconds") are qualified by the factors above.

### Scalability Features
- Serverless Firebase Functions for AI proxying.
- Efficient audio chunk processing.
- Optimized Firebase queries.
- Memory-efficient component updates.

## 🔒 **Security & Privacy**

### Data Protection
- ✅ Secure audio transmission via HTTPS to Firebase Function proxies.
- ✅ API Keys for AI services are managed as secure environment variables in Firebase Functions, not exposed to the client.
- ✅ Encrypted storage in Firebase (default Firestore/Storage encryption).
- ✅ Permission-based access control (Firebase Auth).
- ✅ User consent for audio recording.

### Privacy Features
- ✅ Local audio processing options (not directly applicable when using cloud STT, but client manages audio capture).
- ✅ Configurable data retention (manual data deletion, Firestore TTL policies can be explored).
- ✅ User-controlled transcription sharing.
- ✅ GDPR compliance considerations.

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

### Unit Tests
- Component rendering and interaction tests (React Testing Library).
- Service method validation for frontend services.
- Firebase Function unit tests (Vitest, `firebase-functions-test`), mocking AI SDKs.
- Error handling scenarios.
- Mock implementation verification.

### Integration Tests (Area for Future Expansion)
- End-to-end transcription workflow (Client → Firebase Function → AI Service → Client).
- Firebase integration validation (Firestore rules, complex queries).

### Performance Tests (Area for Future Expansion)
- Audio processing latency measurement under various conditions.
- Memory usage optimization.
- Concurrent user handling for proxy functions.
- Real-time update performance.

## 🚀 **Deployment Readiness**

    - OpenAI API key (e.g., `openai.key="YOUR_OPENAI_KEY"`)
    *Set using `firebase functions:config:set ...`*
- (Optional) WebSocket server configuration if used for other real-time features.
